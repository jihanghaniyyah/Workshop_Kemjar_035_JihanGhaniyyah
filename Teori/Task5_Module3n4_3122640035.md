<h3>Module 3</h3>

Firewalls are devices or programs that control the flow of network traffic between networks or hosts that employ differing security postures [1]. A host-based firewall is a piece of firewall software that runs on an individual computer or device connected to a network [2]. These types of firewalls are granular way to protect the individual hosts from viruses and malware, and to control the spread of there harmful infections throughout the network.<br><br>

Vulnerability management is the ongoing, regular process of identifying, assessing, reporting on, managing, and remediating cyber vulnerabilities across endpoints, workloads, and systems. Typically, a security team will leverage a vulnerability management tool to detect vulnerabilities and utilize different processes to patch or remediate them [3].<br><br>

<img src="Images/Task 5 - Knowledge Check/3.png" width="700"> <br>
Cyber Security Framework provide the structure and methodology that can protect the digital assets [4]. A cyber security framework is a series of documented processes that are used to define policies and procedures that are including guidelines, standards, and best practices to manage security risks [5].<br><br>

<img src="Images/Task 5 - Knowledge Check/4.png" width="700"> <br>
Security auditors review computer security systems. Security auditors also assess the safety and efficacy of computer systems. They provide detailed reports, identify weaknesses, and offer suggestions for improvement [6].<br><br>

<img src="Images/Task 5 - Knowledge Check/5.png" width="700"> <br>
A firewall is software or firmware that prevents unauthorized access to a computer or network by restricting access.<br><br>

<img src="Images/Task 5 - Knowledge Check/6.png" width="700"> <br>
There are three primary classifications of security controls. These include management, operational, and physical. Physical security is the protection of personnel, data, hardware, etc., from physical threats that could harm, damage, or disrupt business operations or impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of systems and/or data [7].<br><br>

<img src="Images/Task 5 - Knowledge Check/7.png" width="700"> <br>
A VPN encrypts the connections between organization’s private networks and an employee’s device (or the connection between two private networks), thus providing protection from manipulator-in-the-middle attacks. VPNs also provide isolation to internal networks to prevent
their exposure to the public internet. Additionally, VPNs help to secure all data flowing into an organization’s internal network, safeguarding it from external threats [8].<br><br>

<h3>Module 4</h3>

<img src="Images/Task 5 - Knowledge Check/8.png" width="700"> <br>
Top Management play a big role in the overall security implementation.<br><br>

<img src="Images/Task 5 - Knowledge Check/9.png" width="700"> <br>
Security auditors are responsible for assuring that security plans and controls are implemented correctly. They help in identifying practices that are non-compliant to existing policies or standards. In addition, they will discuss opportunities for improvements with the relevant stakeholders.<br><br>

<img src="Images/Task 5 - Knowledge Check/10.png" width="700"> <br>
Software developers are responsible for writing and coding individual programs or providing an entirely new software resource based on requirements. From the security perspective, a software developer must also be able to understand OWASP Secure Coding Practices such as SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting.<br><br>

<img src="Images/Task 5 - Knowledge Check/11.png" width="700"> <br>
Digital Forensic Analysts are responsible for recovering and examining data from computers and other electronic storage devices in order to use the data evidence in investigations or in criminal prosecutions. A digital forensic analyst is important to have understanding the
aftermath of a cyber security attack or breach. This sometimes requires correlating information obtained from logs, net flows, and other resources.<br><br>
